# Student and Course Management System
This is a student and course management system program that allows users to manage several tasks for a group of students in a system. It is a menu-driven program that runs until the user chooses to exit. 


## Student Management System: 
Users can add a new student to the system, activate or inactivate a student, display all students, search for a student, assign on-campus job to students, and display students with on-campus job.

- Add Student: User input first name, last name, and grade level for a student. A random ID number is then assigned to the student.
- Deactivate Student: User inputs an ID number and then searches for the student in the array. If the ID matches a student in the array, we will set their status to inactive. 
- Display all Students: Sort all students in the system by first name and print all students.
- Search of Student: User inputs an ID number and then searches for the student in the array. If the ID matches a student in the array, we will print out the student's info. 
- Assign on campus job: User inputs an ID number and then searches for the student in the array. If the ID matches a student in the array, we will assign the student to the jobs (TA or RA).
- Display all students with on-campus job: Print all students with on-campus job only. 

## Course Management System:
Users can add a new course to the system, assign student to a new course, and display all students with assigned courses. 

- Add new course: User inputs a course ID and course name to add a new course. 
- Assign student to a new course: User inputs an ID number and then searches for the student in the array. If the ID matches a student in the array, we will assign the student to the course.
- Display students with assigned courses: Print all students that only have been assigned to new courses.
